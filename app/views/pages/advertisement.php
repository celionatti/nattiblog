                Hello</h2>
            <div class="mx-4">
                <p>These are the Buzz Vibez’s terms of use. They tell you:</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled mx-4">
                    <li>The rules for using our services</li>
                    <li>What you can do with our content (share it, link to it, that sort of thing)</li>
                    <li>What we can do with things you post or upload.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your rights and responsibilities, basically – important stuff.</p>
                <p>We’ve kept them as short as possible, and we’ve made videos for the complicated bits. So do read
                    them, and check in for
                    updates as the latest version always applies (we’ll usually only make updates when we release a new
                    service, change how
                    we provide a service, or have to comply with a new legal requirement).
